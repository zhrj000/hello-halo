/**
 * Registry Adapter Interface
 *
 * Each adapter is responsible for fetching and normalising data from one
 * external registry protocol into the canonical RegistryIndex / AppSpec
 * shapes used by the rest of the store system.
 *
 * Adding a new source = adding one file that implements this interface.
 * No other core logic needs to change.
 *
 * Two data strategies:
 *   - mirror:  Small/static sources. Full index downloaded, stored in SQLite.
 *   - proxy:   Large API sources. Queries forwarded on demand, results cached.
 *
 * Beyond the catalog, the interface also declares the optional backend surface
 * (handshake, install ledger, collections, creator publications, ops-managed
 * page documents). Optional means the SOURCE decides what it implements — the
 * composition layer calls `adapter.x?.(source)` and a source without the method
 * costs zero requests. See DESIGN.md §2.
