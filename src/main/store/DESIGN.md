# Store Module Design

> Read `.claude/skills/halo-dev` (CONTEXT.md → ARCHITECTURE.md → quick.md) first.
> This document is the contract for `src/main/store/**`. Where it and the code
> disagree, the code wins and this document must be corrected.

## 1. Two axes

The store has exactly two structural axes. Every file belongs to one of them.

| Axis | Unit | Where | Shape |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Source driver** | one registry source | `adapters/` | polymorphism — one class per protocol |
| **Composition** | N sources | everything above `adapters/` | aggregation — merge, project, cache, validate |

A store is **not** a polymorphic object. It is a federation of sources, closer
to `mount` than to a filesystem: several sources are active at once and a
catalog read merges all of them. The community build ships five enabled
sources; an enterprise build ships one (the rest are `hidden: true` via
`product.json`). **A federation of one degrades to an exclusive store for
free** — there is no second design for the enterprise edition, and no code
path that only enterprise takes.

Consequence: adding support for a new registry protocol means adding one file
under `adapters/`, one `case` in `adapters/index.ts`, and one entry in
`STORE_SOURCE_TYPES` (`shared/store/store-types.ts`), from which both the
`RegistrySource` type and the config-validation enum derive. Nothing else
changes.

## 2. The adapter contract

`adapters/types.ts` declares three tiers:

```
required     fetchSpec                       — without it, it is not a source
             fetchIndex   (mirror strategy)
             query        (proxy strategy)

optional     fetchDocument, fetchBundledSkills
catalog

optional     serverFeatures, openInstallOrder, fetchCollections,
backend      fetchMyPublications, unpublish              (per source)
             fetchPageTaxonomy, fetchPageLayout          (primary source only)
```

**Optional means the source decides.** The architecture assigns no work: a
driver that does not implement `fetchCollections` simply has no such method,
and the composition layer's `adapter.fetchCollections?.(source) ?? []` issues
zero requests. This is what replaces the six divergent HTTP-status-code
branches the module used to carry.

Backend methods return `unknown` on purpose. The payload is untrusted remote
data; the driver is responsible for transport only. Validation
(`validateTaxonomy`, `validateLayout`, `mapCollection`, `mapPublication`)
stays in the domain module that owns the resulting shape.

### 2.1 Cardinality: per-source vs primary-only

| Endpoint | Cardinality | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| capabilities handshake | per source | each backend advertises itself |
| install ledger | per source | an install belongs to the source it came from |
| collections | per source | curated bundles merge |
| my publications / unpublish | **primary only** | one identity token ⇒ one attributing store (§3.4) |
| category taxonomy | **primary only** | there is one chip row |
| discover layout | **primary only** | there is one discover page |

Merging N discover layouts has no meaning. Someone must decide, and the
decision follows the existing `isDefault` flag — never a source id or name.

### 2.2 Read degrades, write raises

```ts
// read: absent method → empty result, zero requests
const raw = await adapter.fetchPageLayout?.(source) ?? null

// write: absent method → explicit error, never a silent no-op
if (!adapter.unpublish) throw new Error('This store does not support …')
```

A user pressing "Unpublish" on a store with no backend must be told so.
Nothing happening is the worst possible outcome.

### 2.3 `fetchIndex` is a conditional request

```ts
fetchIndex(source, validators?: IndexValidators): Promise<FetchIndexResult>
// FetchIndexResult = { index: RegistryIndex | null, validators: IndexValidators }
```

`index: null` is not "empty" and not "failed" — it means **revalidated,
unchanged**, and the caller must leave the mirror alone. A driver that cannot
revalidate simply always returns an index; the caller needs no branch for it.

`validators` is an opaque map keyed by whatever the driver splits its index
into (the DHP source fetches one file per app type, so it keys by file). The
driver only echoes what the server gave it — `sync.service.ts` persists the map
in `registry_sync_state.etag` and hands it back on the next fetch, without ever
interpreting it. A driver may therefore switch from `ETag` to any other
validator without touching the sync layer.

A mixed response (some files 304, some 200) yields an index: the unchanged
files are re-read from the mirror so the result is always a whole index, never
a partial one.

Page documents revalidate the same way, but with three outcomes rather than
two — `absent | unchanged | ok` (`PageDocumentResult`). Absence and "unchanged"
must stay distinct: a source that stops serving a layout falls the caller
through to the built-in, while a 304 means keep the one already held. The
resolver keeps the held document and its validator across `invalidate`, which
expires only the TTL — dropping the validator would make every forced re-read a
full download, which is the opposite of what invalidating is for.

## 3. Invariants (non-negotiable)

### 3.1 The handshake does not decide whether a driver method exists

The server mounts its three subsystems on **different** conditions
(`cmd/registry/server.go`): the install-order route is mounted
unconditionally, `/my/publications` requires the introspector, and
`/capabilities` itself lives inside the admin block together with
collections / taxonomy / discover-layout.

A ledger-only deployment (no admin console) therefore answers `404` on
`/capabilities` while `POST /apps/{slug}/installs` works normally.

> **Never gate a driver method on the handshake result.**
> `if (features.installs) …` before recording an install would silently drop
> every install count in that deployment.

Which methods exist is decided by `sourceType` — a deployment fact, known at
release time. Which surfaces the UI shows is decided by the handshake — an ops
setting, changeable without a client release. Two different questions, two
different mechanisms.

### 3.2 `features.installs` is not "can record installs"

Server side these are two subsystems:

- `capabilities.installs` ← `s.installs != nil` — the index carries
  `meta.installs`, i.e. **display data**.
- the install ledger ← `s.ledger != nil` — the **write side**.

Client side `capabilities.installs` only decides whether `StoreCard` /
`StoreDetail` render an install-count number. It says nothing about whether
opening an install order is possible.

### 3.3 Handshake cache: per source, with stale-retry

The adapters are stateless singletons except for the DHP v2 driver's
handshake cache, which is a `Map` keyed by source URL — a federation may hold
several `dhp-v2` sources, so a module-level single variable would cross-talk.

| Outcome | Cache policy |
|---|---|
| 200 / 404 / 501 | cache for **1 h** |
| 5xx / 429 / network error | keep **last-known** value, retry after **5 min** |

The second row is load-bearing: one backend blip must not lock the read-only
baseline in for an hour.

### 3.4 Identity-bound calls target the primary source only

A build mints one identity token from the one provider declared in
`product.json.identityProvider`, so exactly one store can attribute a
publication to this user. "My publications" therefore reads and unpublishes
against the primary source — reads included.

Federating the read while writing to the primary would be incoherent twice
over: the user could act on a row the write path cannot address, and the
deployment's token would be handed to sources that are not its own (the
built-in set includes third-party brands, and `sourceType` is settable through
the add-registry API).

Collections federate because they carry no credential.

### 3.5 `openInstallOrder` is a three-state contract

| Return | Meaning | Ledger module's action |
|---|---|---|
| `InstallGrant` | authorised | use the granted path |
| `null` | 4xx permanent refusal, or no such endpoint | indexed path, **do not queue** |
| `throw` | 5xx / 429 / network fault | **queue for backfill** |

The split of duty is deliberate: the **driver** decides whether the transport
failure is retryable (protocol semantics); **`install-orders.ts`** decides
whether a retryable failure enters the backfill queue (ledger policy).

### 3.5.1 The ledger hangs off the download, not off an entry point

`acquireSpec()` in `registry.service.ts` is the single place an **install**
acquires its spec, and the only place an order is opened. Every install path —
the store button, an upgrade (auto or manual), a non-bundled skill dependency,
an install an agent performs — reaches it, so a new path is counted without
being told to be. The previous hook sat on the store button alone and missed the
other three.

Three consequences that read as surprises otherwise:

- **A skill dependency counts, every time it is fetched.** It is a separate
  artifact pulled over the network, so re-installing a parent re-downloads and
  re-counts its non-bundled dependencies. That is the caliber working, not a
  leak: bytes moved. It also keeps `AppManager`'s skill-overwrite path, which is
  how a dependency with damaged local files gets repaired.
- **Bundled skills do not count separately.** They travel inside the parent's
  package (`fetchBundledSkills`), so they are already counted as part of it.
- **Each call site resolves its own source.** `installFromStore` resolves by
  slug, `applyUpgrade` by slug + the installed app's `registry_id`. Sharing one
  resolution would open the order against source A and download from source B
  in a federation (§2.1).

Browsing is not installing: `query.service.ts` fetches specs for the detail view
without an order, and must keep doing so.

`installs` therefore means *authorised* downloads: an order is opened before the
transfer, so one that then fails locally still counts. A delivery receipt would
cost a second round trip and would undercount exactly when the receipt is what
gets lost.

### 3.5.2 One install is one intent, not one attempt

The server counts distinct `orderUuid`s. The client mints one per
`(source, slug, version)`, persists it in
`~/.halo/store-install-intents.json`, reuses it for every retry, and drops it
once the download lands (`completeInstallIntent`).

This is load-bearing, not bookkeeping. The upgrade scheduler retries a failed
upgrade every tick and never gives up, so a uuid minted per attempt would bill
one install per device per tick for as long as a release stayed broken —
silently, and indistinguishably from real re-installs. Two deliberate user
installs of the same version are two intents and do count twice.

A client that predates the field sends no uuid and the server falls back to its
old device+app+version key, which never counts a re-install. Both paths are
deleted together, once no client sends the empty value.

### 3.6 Federated aggregation is partial-failure tolerant

`Promise.all` rejects on the first failure, which would make one broken source
blank the whole page — worse than the bug this refactor fixes. Aggregation
uses `Promise.allSettled`:

| Outcome | Behavior |
|---|---|
| all failed | throw — the caller renders a load error |
| some failed | return the successes, `console.warn` the failures |
| all succeeded | merge |

This applies within an adapter too, wherever one logical query fans out to
several requests (SkillHub splits a Halo category across the SkillHub keys it
covers). Items survive partial failure, but a count does not: an adapter that
served only part of its fan-out returns `AdapterQueryResult.partial`, and
`queryProxySources` reports that source as `status: 'error'` while still
contributing its items. A partial result is also never written to the query
cache — the cache row has no column for the reason, so reading it back would
present an undercounted total as a complete one.

### 3.7 Known deferral: publish target resolution is not federated

`publish/index.ts` still reads `registryOverrides['official'].publish`.
Federating it means the user must *choose* a destination, which is a new UI
flow and an independent feature. It is deliberately out of scope here — not an
oversight, and not a counter-example to §1.

### 3.8 Known deferral: the collections error state is not rendered

`backend/collections.ts` distinguishes "no collections" from "load failed" by
throwing. That distinction stops at `discover-page.ts`, whose per-task
tolerance (§3.10) drops the failed section, so the page reads the same either
way. Rendering the difference needs a UI-level error state and a payload that
can carry it, and is left as a separate change.

### 3.9 Known deferral: two `sourceType` branches survive above `adapters/`

`query.service.ts` (`supportsType`) and `registry.service.ts` (the
catalog-only preview shortcut for `claude-skills` / `skillhub`) still switch on
`sourceType`. Both predate this design and both encode the same thing: a
*static capability of the protocol* — which app types it can serve, and whether
its detail view needs a network fetch. They belong on the adapter as declared
properties (`supportedAppTypes`, `catalogOnly`), which would delete the
branches outright. That is a behaviour-preserving refactor of the catalog read
path and is deliberately out of scope here; until it lands, these two are the
registered exceptions to §1, like `publish/index.ts` is to §3.7.

### 3.10 The discover page is resolved here, in one payload

`discover-page.ts` returns the operator's layout with every section's entries
already resolved (`storeGetDiscoverPage`). The renderer neither fetches the
layout nor filters, sorts or ranks — those IPC endpoints do not exist.

This is not a transport optimisation. Sections are ranked and filtered against
the **full index mirror**, which only this process holds; the renderer's browse
list is paginated and its "All" tab is a per-type preview, so a ranking
resolved there would silently score over a fraction of the catalog. The catalog
node deliberately goes through the same browse query the renderer uses for
later pages, so page 1 and page 2 cannot disagree on ordering.

Assembly is per-task tolerant, one step beyond §3.6: layout, index, collections
and catalog each fall back independently, and a layout that resolves to nothing
still renders the catalog. No single failure may blank the store.

`discover-resolve.ts` holds the section semantics (filter → sort → limit, or a
curated slug list that is authoritative for both membership and order). It is
deliberately **not** in `shared/`: nothing outside this process resolves
sections, and putting it in `shared/` would invite a renderer to try.

**Collection membership resolves here too**, for the same reason and by the same
rule. A collection travels from ops as slugs; the payload carries the entries.
Resolving slugs in the renderer looks harmless — it is a map lookup — but the
only map available there is the browse list, so a collection curated with more
members than fit on catalog page 1 renders as however many happen to land in it.
The type says so: `ResolvedDiscoverNode.collections` is `ResolvedCollection[]`,
which carries `entries`, and the renderer has no way to build one.

### 3.11 Freshness is triggered by the user arriving, not by a timer

Everything the store shows is cached — the index in SQLite, the page documents
per TTL, the renderer's resources for the session. Nothing re-reads on a timer,
so a client left running all day would otherwise never see a newly published
app or an operator's layout change.

`revalidateStore` is the one entry point: it re-runs the conditional index
fetch (§2.3) and drops **every** page-document cache. The invariant is that it
drops *all* of them — `backend/` exports exactly two invalidators
(`taxonomy.ts`, `discover.ts`) and both are called; a third cache added there
must be added here in the same change, or it silently goes stale.

It is triggered on **every arrival at a store tab** — the tab row, entering the
store, and the window regaining focus. The floor is 2 s, which swallows a
double-click and nothing else: the check is conditional requests end to end, so
an unchanged store costs only 304s and running it per tab switch is the intended
price of never showing a withdrawn app.

`changed: true` reloads the visible list, not just the cache behind it. An
operator hiding an app has to disappear from the grid the user is looking at;
dropping the cache alone would defer that to their next navigation. The page
documents are re-read either way, because ops config can change without the
index moving.

Identity values name a **capability**, never a provider. A third party running
its own registry must be able to advertise account-level identity without
uttering another company's internal system name.

### 3.12 A category chip's number is that chip's own query

`useStoreCategoryCounts` reads each chip's count from a `pageSize: 1` probe of
the chip's own query, rather than tallying one fetched page: on a source larger
than the page, a tally is a sample of that page, so a 139k-skill catalog renders
as "Content 7" beside an accurate "All 139697".

That puts two obligations on every proxy adapter (stated on `query` in
`adapters/types.ts`, which is where a new adapter will read them):

- **`params.category` must be honoured.** A source with no taxonomy of its own
  still labels its entries with one Halo category, so ignoring the filter
  answers a chip with the whole catalog under a name that does not describe it.
  Serving nothing under a category is a valid answer — return empty.
- **`total` describes the whole filtered catalog**, not the page returned with
  it.

The probes are bounded to a few in flight: a taxonomy is ~8 chips, each a
federated query fanning out to every source serving the type, and the reply to
a rate-limited probe is a source error the hook has to discard anyway.

Neither the count nor the "All" number is rendered unless its query answered for
the *whole* catalog — a store query succeeds with whatever sources replied, so a
timed-out registry silently subtracts its share and would otherwise show a
smaller number just as confidently. The real fix is a facet endpoint returning
every category count in one call; the probes are what the current list API
allows.

| Wire (`identityBinding`) | Client (`StoreIdentityMode`) | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `account` | `account` | authoritative per-person identity, cross-device |
| `shared` | `shared` | deployment-level shared credential |
| `none` | `none` | anonymous |

Server side the *mechanism* (`auth.type`: `token` / `introspect` /
`token+introspect`) is kept separate from the *strength* it yields
(`identityBinding`). A future mechanism (mTLS, mutual OIDC, …) that also
reaches account strength changes `auth.type` only; no client changes.

## 5. Persistence

`~/.halo/store-install-orders.pending.json` — the backfill queue, de-duplicated
by `orderUuid` so a retry of one intent does not queue twice while a genuinely
new intent does.

`~/.halo/store-install-intents.json` — the live intent per
`registryId|slug@version` (§3.5.2), capped at 200 entries. Minting an intent for
an app drops any other intent for the same app on the same source: an app has at
most one install in flight per source.

`~/.halo/store-install-id` — the device identifier, owned by the store rather
than by telemetry so counting survives analytics being disabled.

Older queue entries lack `orderUuid` (replayed under the server's legacy key) or
`registryId` (resolved against the primary source). Both reproduce the previous
behaviour exactly, so no versioned migration is required.

Source resolution is **injected** into `flushPendingInstallOrders`. The ledger
module imports nothing from `registry.service`, which is what keeps the two out
of an import cycle now that the composition layer calls the ledger.

## 6. File map

Directories are named after responsibility. `backend/` is the layer that
consumes the *source's* backend surface (§2) — it is not server code; nothing
in it runs anywhere but the main process.

```
adapters/                 source drivers — the only polymorphic layer
  types.ts                the contract
  index.ts                sourceType → driver (the discoverable catalogue)
  halo.adapter.ts         DHP static source (GitHub Pages / mirror), catalog only
  dhp-v2.adapter.ts       DHP v2 full protocol: catalog (delegated to Halo)
                          + 7 backend endpoints + handshake + wire vocabulary
  mcp-registry / smithery / skillhub / claude-skills

backend/                  consumers of the backend surface
  sources.ts              the two read cardinalities: federated aggregation
                          (§3.6) and primary-source page documents (§2.1)
  capabilities.ts         projection: primary source features + publish target
  install-orders.ts       install ledger: installId, backfill queue, retry policy
  collections.ts          federated aggregation + payload mapping
  publications.ts         federated read / primary write + NOT_SIGNED_IN semantics
  taxonomy.ts             server ?? product.json ?? built-in
  discover.ts             server ?? built-in
  identity.ts             identity-token resolution (product.json → AI-source OAuth)

discover-page.ts          the discover page, resolved in one payload (§3.10)
discover-resolve.ts       section semantics: filter → sort → limit / slug list

registry.service.ts       source config, CRUD, install/upgrade orchestration
query.service.ts          catalog aggregation (already federated)
sync.service.ts           mirror sync → SQLite, validator round-trip (§2.3)
registry.cache.ts, store-cache.schema.ts, upgrade.service.ts, registry.types.ts

publish/                  publish dispatchers (see §3.7)
dhpkg/, skill-pkg.ts      packaging
```

## 6.1 Vocabulary

One concept, one word: this module is the **store**. `Marketplace` survives only
as the user-facing label of the Apps page tab (`t('Marketplace')`) and the
navigation action named after it; no type, function, file, or directory carries
it.

## 7. Checks that must keep passing

- `getOfficialRegistryUrl` does not exist.
- `'official'` appears in `registry.service.ts` only at its definition
  (`BUILTIN_REGISTRIES[0].id`); `publish/index.ts` is the registered
  exception of §3.7.
- `fetchWithTimeout` is called only from inside `adapters/`.
- `sourceType` is switched on only in `adapters/index.ts`; `query.service.ts`
  and `registry.service.ts` are the registered exceptions of §3.9.
- The protocol list is written once, in `STORE_SOURCE_TYPES`
  (`shared/store/store-types.ts`); the config schema derives its enum from it.
- `resolveSection` has no consumer outside `src/main/store/` (§3.10).
- A driver that delegates `fetchIndex` forwards its validators (§2.3). Dropping
  them compiles, runs, and returns a usable index — it just never revalidates,
  so only a test catches it.
- Every `invalidate*Cache` exported from `backend/` is called by
  `revalidateStore` (§3.11).
- No file above `adapters/` reads an HTTP status code. (Each driver reads its
  own protocol's codes; `publish/dispatchers/*` read their upload responses.
  The rule is about the composition layer, not about a single file.)
- A community build entering the store and installing an app issues **zero**
  requests to `/installs`, `/collections`, `/my/publications`,
  `/category-taxonomy.json`, `/discover-layout.json`.
