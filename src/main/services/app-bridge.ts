/**
 * Apps bridge — dependency-inversion seam for the services tier.
 *
 * The Apps layer sits ABOVE services in the dependency DAG
 * (`apps -> services -> platform -> foundation`). A handful of services
 * (the agent engine, space service) legitimately need app data at runtime
 * — the installed MCP apps for a space, the in-process "Halo Apps" MCP
 * server, and notification when MCP apps change. Importing `apps/*` from
 * `services/*` would invert the layer direction.
 *
 * Instead, services depend on this bridge (same tier), and the Apps layer
 * registers its concrete implementations at startup via `registerAppBridge`
 * (a downward call). This mirrors the IM-channel manager accessor pattern
 * in `apps/runtime/im-channels/index.ts`.
 *
 * Type-only imports from `apps/*` are erased at compile time and create no
 * runtime edge, so they are used freely here to keep the surface typed.
