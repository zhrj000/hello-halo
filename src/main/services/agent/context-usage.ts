 * Context usage accounting — engine-agnostic.

 * specific SDK. Halo runs multiple engines (claude-agent-sdk, codex, hello-halo)
 * that all normalize to the same per-turn frame contract, so this module reads
 * only the normalized `assistant`/`result`/`message_delta` usage and our own
 * model-capability table — never an SDK-specific control method or field.
 *
 * The "current context size" equals the most recent per-call frame's
 * `input_tokens + cache_creation + cache_read`. This mirrors claude-code
 * `getCurrentUsage` + `analyzeContextUsage`: output_tokens is the generated
 * reply, not part of the prompt the model saw, so it is excluded.
 *
 * "Per-call" is load-bearing. The `result` frame reports the turn's CUMULATIVE
 * usage (see DESIGN.md §2), which equals the current context only on a
 * single-call turn and a multiple of it otherwise — so it is never a source
 * for this number, however tempting a fallback it looks like.
