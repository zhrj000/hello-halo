 * credential and another entry on the auth path's linear scan. Callers hit this
 * on every message and every session warm-up, so per-call issuance grew the
 * store with conversation volume.

 * Reuse is also what makes the store bounded without eviction: a warm session
 * holds its token inside an already-spawned process env, and handing it back
 * the same value keeps it valid, which naive expiry would not.
