/**
 * IM Channel — Multi-instance channel architecture
 *
 * Defines the contracts for the IM channel system:
 *
 *   ImChannelProvider  — Channel type definition ("driver")
 *   ImChannelInstance   — A running connection instance
 *   ImChannelAdapter    — Channel-agnostic push interface (subset of Instance)
 *   ImChannelInstanceConfig — Persisted configuration for one instance
 *   ImSessionRecord     — Known IM session with instanceId binding
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   Provider (type definition) → creates N Instances (running connections)
 *   Each Instance binds to exactly one digital human (appId)
 *   Multiple Instances can bind to the same appId (N:1 supported)
 *   ImChannelManager manages all instances' lifecycle
 *
 * Design principles:
 * - Platform-agnostic — WeCom/Feishu/DingTalk use the same model
 * - No protocol details in shared types — only text + target identifiers
 * - Markdown as the universal message format (adapters convert internally)
 * - Synchronous success/failure return (no retry logic — caller decides)
 * - Plugin-ready — providers can be registered dynamically
