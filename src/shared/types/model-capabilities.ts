/**
 * Model Capabilities - Type Definitions
 *
 * Describes what each model can do (context window, vision, thinking, etc.).
 * Separates model capability metadata from AI source/channel configuration.
 *
 * Design:
 *   - Preset data lives in src/shared/data/model-capabilities.json
 *   - Users can override any field per-model inside their AISource config
 *   - Priority, highest first: user override > `[1m]` id suffix (contextWindow
 *     only) > exact preset entry > provider catalog data > family pattern
 *     entry > built-in defaults. A pattern is a family guess and ranks below
 *     the provider's live catalog; an exact entry is curated and ranks above
 *     it. Resolved in src/main/services/model-capabilities.service.ts.
 *   - Vision has its own resolution chain implemented in
 *     src/shared/constants/model-capabilities.ts — every consumer
 *     (renderer hint, backend config, image fallback) resolves through it.
 *
 * TODO(shared/models): this concern is spread across six files in four
 * directories — types/model-capabilities.ts, constants/model-capabilities.ts,
 * constants/model-runtime-limits.ts, data/model-capabilities.json,
 * model-catalog.ts and model-capability-overrides.ts. Nothing in the paths
 * tells a newcomer where capability resolution lives. Fold them into
 * `src/shared/models/` (preset-lookup / runtime-limits / catalog / overrides /
 * types). Deferred deliberately: it is an import-only move touching many
 * unrelated files and does not belong in a behavioural change.
